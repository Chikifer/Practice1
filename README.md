Conclusion
In this practice, I learned the basics of KiCad and how it can be used for designing. It wasn't the first time I heard about 
this program: in the past, I saw someone working with a PCB, and the application he used to elaborate it was this, but I didn't 
knew what was it until now. The tutorial was monstly easy, but too slow, because we didn't do much, and I was surprised at the
end, when I saw what I had to do. After placing components, and thanks to the tables posted here, it wasn't difficult, and allowed
me to observe the enormous library KiCad can offer to its users.
